<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>VPS Hosting Server</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A VPS hosting server is a physical server that's been divided into multiple virtual servers. So each virtual server gets its own allocation of the resources available on the physical server, which includes CPU time, memory, and disk space. You can think of it as a dedicated server, but without the high price tag. And because you're sharing the physical server with other websites, the cost of operating a VPS is considerably lower than running your own server.</p>
